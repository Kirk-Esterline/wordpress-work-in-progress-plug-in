<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

While working on a project update I routinely got confused regarding which site was live and which was my local test environment. I put this plug-in together quickly to give myself a reminder which site was which and to ensure that the changes ended up in the production version not only my local environment.
